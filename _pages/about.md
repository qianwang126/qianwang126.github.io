This is Dr. Qian Wang's home on the web!
I am currently a senior research scientist for security and privacy research at Intel Labs. I will join UC Merced EE department as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Jan 2024. I received my Ph.D degree from University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Professor [Gang Qu](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). My research endeavors revolve around the intersection of hardware security and machine/deep learning, with a focus on practical applications in domains such as autonomous vehicles, anomaly detection, hardware/circuit security, and cryptographic circuitry.

Research Highlights
======
In the past, I have conducted several projects on conventional hardware security, such as side-channel attacks and countermeasures, hardware trojan attacks and detection techniques, hardware-intrinsic security primitives (e.g., PUF, TRNG, and PQC/FHE/NTT).  Furthermore, my interests extend to the application of hardware security within the domain of machine learning systems. This includes investigations into model attestation, model fingerprinting, and the integration of machine learning in trusted execution environments. I am also excited about cryptographic algorithms and their susceptibility to side-channel analysis, with a keen focus on the recent advancements in post-quantum cryptography.



For Prospective Students.
======
•	PhD openings: 
------
I am looking for multiple self-motivated PhD students starting in 2024 Spring or Fall (application occurs in Dec 2023). Students with strong research background in security/ML system/Cryptography applications are preferred. If you are a prospective PhD student, I highly suggest reaching out to me early so that we can both check if there is a fit between us.

•	Intern openings: 
------
I am also looking for self-motivated remote intern students starting at any time. Similarly, students with strong research background are preferred. I would prefer that you are interested in working with me as a PhD student in the long run.

•	Email format: 
------
"Interested in {position, e.g., Ph.D.} at {expected time, e.g., Fall 2024}”):
- CV: Include your background, experiences, and future research interests.
